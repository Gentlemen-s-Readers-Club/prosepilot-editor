# Subscription Management Implementation

This document describes the subscription cancellation and upgrading functionality that has been implemented in your ProsePilot application.

## Overview

The subscription management system allows users to:

- Cancel their active subscriptions
- Upgrade their subscriptions to higher-tier plans
- View detailed information about what happens during these actions

## Components Added

### 1. Supabase Edge Function: `handle-paddle-subscription`

**Location:** `supabase/functions/handle-paddle-subscription/index.ts`

This edge function handles the communication with Paddle's API for subscription management operations.

**Supported Actions:**

- `cancel`: Cancels a subscription at the end of the current billing period
- `change_plan`: Changes a subscription to a new plan (supports both upgrades and downgrades)

**Environment Variables Required:**

- `PADDLE_API_KEY`: Your Paddle API key
- `PADDLE_ENVIRONMENT`: Either "sandbox" or "production"

### 2. Subscription Management Service

**Location:** `src/services/subscriptionManagement.ts`

This service provides frontend utilities for managing subscriptions.

**Key Functions:**

- `cancelSubscription(subscriptionId)`: Cancels a subscription
- `upgradeSubscription(subscriptionId, newPlanId)`: Upgrades a subscription
- `getUpgradeOptions(currentPriceId)`: Gets available upgrade options
- `getPlanChangeType(currentPriceId, newPriceId)`: Determines if a change is an upgrade or downgrade

### 3. Subscription Management Component

**Location:** `src/components/SubscriptionManagement.tsx`

This React component provides the UI for subscription management.

**Features:**

- Upgrade button with plan selection dialog
- Cancel button with confirmation dialog
- Pending cancellation status display
- Loading states and error handling
- Success notifications

## Integration

The subscription management functionality has been integrated into your existing `src/pages/Subscription.tsx` page. It appears for each active subscription in the "My Subscriptions" section.

## Usage

### For Users

1. **Upgrading a Subscription:**

   - Click the "Upgrade Plan" button on an active subscription
   - Select the desired plan from the upgrade options
   - Confirm the upgrade (prorated charges apply immediately)

2. **Cancelling a Subscription:**
   - Click the "Cancel Subscription" button on an active subscription
   - Confirm the cancellation in the dialog
   - The subscription will remain active until the end of the current billing period

### For Developers

The system is designed to be extensible. You can:

1. **Add new subscription actions** by extending the edge function
2. **Customize the UI** by modifying the SubscriptionManagement component
3. **Add more plan options** by updating the plan hierarchy in the service

## Setup Requirements

1. **Deploy the Edge Function:**

   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy handle-paddle-subscription
   ```

2. **Set Environment Variables:**

   ```bash
   supabase secrets set PADDLE_API_KEY=your_paddle_api_key
   supabase secrets set PADDLE_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox # or production
   ```

3. **Ensure Paddle Webhook is Set Up:**
   Your existing webhook should handle the subscription status updates when cancellations and upgrades occur.

## Testing

To test the functionality:

1. **In Sandbox Mode:**

   - Use Paddle's sandbox environment
   - Create test subscriptions
   - Test cancellation and upgrade flows

2. **Key Test Cases:**
   - Cancel an active subscription
   - Upgrade from Starter to Pro
   - Handle edge cases (network errors, API failures)
   - Verify webhook processing of status changes

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:

- Network errors are caught and displayed to users
- Paddle API errors are logged and shown with appropriate messages
- Loading states prevent double-clicks during processing
- Success notifications confirm when actions complete

## Security

- All API calls are authenticated using Supabase session tokens
- The edge function validates requests and handles CORS properly
- Sensitive operations require user confirmation dialogs

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements you could add:

- Downgrade functionality
- Pause/resume subscriptions
- Subscription history tracking
- Billing cycle management
- Proration calculations display
- Email notifications for subscription changes

## Support

The implementation follows your existing patterns and integrates seamlessly with your current subscription system. All existing functionality remains unchanged.
