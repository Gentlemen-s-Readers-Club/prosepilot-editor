# Netlify Forms Integration Setup

This guide explains how to set up and use the Netlify Forms integration for the newsletter subscription form.

## How It Works

Netlify Forms automatically detects and handles form submissions without requiring any backend code. When you deploy your site to Netlify, it will:

1. **Detect forms** with the `data-netlify="true"` attribute
2. **Process submissions** automatically
3. **Store submissions** in your Netlify dashboard
4. **Send notifications** (optional)
5. **Integrate with external services** (optional)

## Current Setup

The `SubscribeForm` component has been updated to use Netlify Forms with:

- `data-netlify="true"` attribute for form detection
- `data-netlify-honeypot="bot-field"` for spam protection
- Hidden form in `index.html` for build-time detection
- Proper form submission handling

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy to Netlify

1. Push your code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
2. Connect your repository to Netlify
3. Deploy your site

### 2. Verify Form Detection

After deployment, check your Netlify dashboard:

1. Go to your site's dashboard
2. Navigate to **Forms** tab
3. You should see a `newsletter-subscription` form listed

### 3. Test the Form

1. Visit your deployed site
2. Use the newsletter subscription form
3. Check the **Forms** tab in your Netlify dashboard for submissions

## Configuration Options

### Email Notifications

To receive email notifications for form submissions:

1. Go to **Forms** → **Settings** in your Netlify dashboard
2. Enable **Email notifications**
3. Add recipient email addresses

### Spam Protection

The form includes:
- **Honeypot field**: Hidden field that bots fill out
- **reCAPTCHA**: Can be enabled in Netlify dashboard
- **Rate limiting**: Automatic protection against spam

### External Integrations

You can connect Netlify Forms to external services:

#### Mailchimp Integration

1. Go to **Forms** → **Settings** → **Integrations**
2. Connect your Mailchimp account
3. Map form fields to Mailchimp fields:
   - `email` → Email Address
   - Add additional fields as needed

#### Zapier Integration

1. Go to **Forms** → **Settings** → **Integrations**
2. Connect Zapier
3. Create workflows to:
   - Send to email marketing tools
   - Add to CRM systems
   - Create tasks in project management tools

## Form Fields

The current form includes:

- **email** (required): User's email address
- **bot-field** (hidden): Honeypot field for spam protection
- **form-name** (hidden): Form identifier

## Customization

### Adding More Fields

To add additional fields (like name, preferences, etc.):

1. Update the form in `SubscribeForm.tsx`
2. Add corresponding fields to the hidden form in `index.html`
3. Update the form submission logic

Example:
```tsx
<Input
  type="text"
  name="firstName"
  placeholder="First Name"
  // ... other props
/>
```

### Styling

The form uses Tailwind CSS classes and can be customized by:
- Modifying the `className` prop
- Adding custom CSS
- Using the `variant` prop for different styles

## Troubleshooting

### Form Not Detected

1. Ensure the hidden form is in `index.html`
2. Check that `data-netlify="true"` is present
3. Verify the form name matches between hidden and visible forms

### Submissions Not Working

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify form field names match
3. Ensure required fields are filled

### Spam Issues

1. Enable reCAPTCHA in Netlify dashboard
2. Check honeypot field is working
3. Review form submissions for patterns
